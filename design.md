Technical Design
Which technologies did you use?
Which technical design choices did you make?
Any lessons learned? E.g., what would you do differently next time?


For our project we decided to use a mix of different technologies and APIs. For login and authentication services, we decided to use Firebase AUTH; the reason we decided on this is because of our prior knowledge with the API, its vast documentation and online help, and it's simplistic desing. For database management and data storage we used Firebase Database for handling our data; as it tied pretty well to our existing use of Firebase for Authentication, making sure both systems worked flawlesly together.
